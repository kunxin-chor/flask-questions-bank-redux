# Advanced Form Processing

A pure HTML form is provided in `raw-form.html`

This form has some attributes missing that makes it not usable by Flask. Change this into a template, add the missing attributes that make its processable in Flask, then
display the form in a route.

Once the user has submitted the form, display all the choices the user has made, and the **total cost** of the booking.
